 Titanic Survival Prediction - Machine Learning Project

**Objective**
Predict Titanic passenger survival using logistic regression and Python.

** Dataset**
- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

**What I Did**
- Cleaned and analyzed data
- Visualized features
- Trained a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluated the model

**Notes**
This was my first dataset project. I fixed some errors myself during the process, which helped me learn practical problem-solving in data science.i tried to interpret the visualizations which helps me to understand the data.
**Tools Used**
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

**Acknowledgement**
